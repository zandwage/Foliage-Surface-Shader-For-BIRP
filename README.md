# Foliage-Surface-Shader-For-BIRP
Edited version of Freedom Coding's HLSL leaves surface shader to support randomized waving of foliage. Also some quality of life changes as being able to define where the perlin noise texture should start displacing the vertices.

## Features:
- Randomized waving foliage using sin waves
- Randomized waving foliage using a noise texture
